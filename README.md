# RSLDA

This project aims to use the concept of RSLDA to implement an improved version of LDA.

## How to run

First, install the required libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any additional libraries are needed, please install them as well.

Then, run `python main.py` from the root directory to execute the program. The outputs will be logged in the log directory.
Note: The default settings take approximately 4 hours to complete (time may vary depending on the hardware environment).
